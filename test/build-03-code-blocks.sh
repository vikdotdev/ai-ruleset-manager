## Code Rule

This rule has code blocks with comments.

### Example

```python
# This is a comment in code
# It should be preserved as-is
def hello():
    pass
```

### Another Example

```bash
# Another comment
echo "test"
```

EOF

# Compare actual vs expected
if ! diff -q "test/tmp/build-03-code-blocks.md" "test/tmp/build-03-expected.md" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "FAIL: Output does not match expected"
    echo "Expected:"
    cat "test/tmp/build-03-expected.md"
    echo ""
    echo "Actual:"
    cat "test/tmp/build-03-code-blocks.md"
    echo ""
    echo "Diff:"
    diff "test/tmp/build-03-expected.md" "test/tmp/build-03-code-blocks.md" || true
    exit 1
